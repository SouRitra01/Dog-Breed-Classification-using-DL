# Project Title: Dog Breed Identification using Deep Learning

## Project Description:

In this project, I tackled the problem of dog breed identification using deep learning techniques. The goal was to build a model that could accurately classify the breed of a dog based on an image of the dog. To achieve this, I used a deep learning architecture that consisted of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning.

The first step was to preprocess the data by resizing the images and converting them to a format suitable for use with deep learning models. Next, I used a pre-trained CNN model as a base, and added additional layers to fine-tune the model to the dog breed identification task. To increase the accuracy of the model, I also experimented with different hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of hidden layers.

The model was trained on a large dataset of images of dogs and their breeds, and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results showed that the model was able to achieve high accuracy in identifying the breed of dogs, with a test accuracy of over 95%.

This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in working with deep learning models for image classification tasks, and demonstrated my ability to apply state-of-the-art techniques to real-world problems.
